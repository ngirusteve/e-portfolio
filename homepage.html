        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome ! 
            <br> This site is dedicated to exhibit my skillset and professional attributes.</br>
            <br> </br>
            I am an aspiring Telecommunication Engineer with a keen eye for communication network infrastructure development
             and security.</b> </br> My main area of interest delves into software development and electronic device development. 
             The two fields can be integrated to develop IoT (Internet of Things) devices, autonomous devices with industrial 
             as well as commercial purposes.</b>
             My particular set of skills include software development using C, microprocessor programming for devices such as 
             Arduino and Raspberry pi, network infrastructure development and back end web development using php and react.</b>

            <h3> Vehicle Emission<br> Monitoring system. </h3>
            
            
            <p> The quality of air is a crucial space. <br> Vehicle gas emissions due to fossil fuel utilization are considered to be polutants.<br> </br>
                The project involved integration of various sensors for data collection and a microcontroller to manage the devices. <br> </br>
                In order to process the data for visualization and decision making purposes, we used a cloud platform called Thingspeak.<br> </br>

            <h3>CCTVWebStream</h3>
            <p>I recently took part in an internship program at Krystalline salt LTD. <br>
                I had the opportunity to work and train under the IT department. This allowed me to take part in<br>
                some projects such as the CCTV webstream.<br>
                This was presented as a challenge by the various Heads of departments at the company. They requested to have<br> 
                access to live stream CCTV footage of their respective areas only.<br> 
                To facilitate such a system, we used php to link the camera feeds from the NVR to each registered head of department. <br>
                The image captured below represents footage from the weighbridge which is granted access to the Loading department and Security department heads.<br>
